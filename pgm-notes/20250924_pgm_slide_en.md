> **The Process Grammar Model (PGM)** offers a human-centric and process-sensitive alternative to traditional grammar theories. Rather than modeling completed sentences, it focuses on **how language is actually produced in real time**, acknowledging disfluency, revision, and affective modulation.

### Key Features:

1. **Two-layered structure (Immediate vs Adjustive Grammar)**

   * Captures the **realistic dynamics of speech**.
   * Explains non-sentential utterances such as interjections, corrections, and vocatives.

2. **Psychologically plausible**

   * Inspired by **System 1 / System 2** dual-process theories.
   * Models linguistic production as both reactive and reflective.

3. **Applicable to classical and spontaneous texts**

   * Particularly powerful in analyzing **Ise Monogatari**, **waka**, and **diaries**, where conventional syntax fails.

4. **Annotation-ready and machine-friendly**

   * Compatible with JSON tagging and suitable for **AI-based corpus studies** and **natural language processing**.

5. **Interdisciplinary relevance**

   * Useful in **education**, **literary analysis**, **psycholinguistics**, and **language assessment**.

> In short, **PGM is a pioneering model** that reconnects grammar with the **lived experience of speaking**.
> It restores the missing human dimension to linguistic theory.

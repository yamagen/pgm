## The Nature of Immediate Grammar: Conventionalization through Simple Word Combinations

- **No grammatical elaboration**:
  Instead of employing conjugated endings or complex syntactic structuring such as _kakarimusubi_, meaning emerges simply by aligning base words in sequence.

- **Speaker’s stance and emotion are exposed**:
  Combinations like “X wa X dakedo” (X is X, but...) use repetition, binary contrast, and concessive conjunctions to immediately express hesitation, guarded affirmation, or euphemistic denial.

- **Lack of apparent regularity**:
  Phrases such as “Suki wa suki dakedo” or “Iku nara iku de” may seem structurally irregular, yet they behave consistently as part of natural spoken language.

- **Unintentional conventionalization**:
  These expressions were **not created with the intent to become idioms**, but over repeated use, they come to possess idiomatic value.

### The Power of Immediate Grammar: Generating Meaning Prior to Syntax

Take for example the expression “X wa X dakedo ne” (X is X, but you know)—only about seven words long, yet structurally composed of:

- Formal topic marking (X wa)
- Emphasis through repetition (X again)
- Emotional contrast (dakedo = but)
- Softening or hedging (ne = you know)

In terms of syntactic description, this string of words may appear impoverished. Yet in actual speech, it carries surprisingly rich meaning.

These phenomena—**simple combinations improvised in the moment behaving like pre-formed idioms**—lie at the core of what makes immediate grammar both elusive and powerful.

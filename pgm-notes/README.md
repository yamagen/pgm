# pgm-notes: Working Notes for the Process Grammar Model

This directory stores fragmentary notes, observations, and reflections related to the development of the Process Grammar Model (PGM), especially focusing on immediate grammar and adjustive grammar.

These notes are intentionally kept informal and open-ended. They are not structured as polished papers but instead serve as snapshots of thinking-in-progress. The immediacy of recording ideas without forcing them into complete arguments aligns with the very spirit of immediate grammar.

Rather than filtering out uncertainty or incompleteness, the goal of this repository is to document the **emergence of insight** â€” moments when linguistic phenomena resist conventional analysis but reveal something profound through context, usage, and interaction.

## Typical Contents

- Descriptions of spontaneous expressions
- Examples of repetition, ellipsis, hesitation, stance
- Observations that challenge rule-based grammar descriptions
- Meta-notes on the research process itself

## Role within the PGM Project

This directory complements the formal components of the PGM project (e.g., papers, glossaries, data sets) by preserving the **raw and reflective** dimension of linguistic research. It is where questions are more important than conclusions.

# All Projects Overview – Updated Edition (English Version)

## General Overview

This document outlines the full structure of ongoing linguistic research projects. At the core lies the Process Grammar Model (PGM), which branches into AEAD, classical text translation, gloss design, software tools, pedagogical applications, and the standardization of descriptive frameworks.

## AEAD: An Expression A Day

AEAD is a long-term project that records one natural utterance per day based on Immediate Grammar principles. It has now surpassed Entry No.400. Each entry is recorded in JSON format, including the Japanese and English expression, semantic intent, usage tags, and an adjusted (formalized) expression.

## Nihongo Notes

_Nihongo Notes – Sounds of Japanese_ is an essay-style series of reflections connected to AEAD and PGM. Volume 1 (No.001–No.014) is scheduled for release via Zenodo at the end of May 2025. Each entry is written in both Japanese and English, with a focus on syntax, meaning, ellipsis, and grammatical philosophy.

## Translation Projects: Ise Monogatari and Tosa Nikki

Both classical works are translated using a three-layer structure: literal translation, phrase gloss, and natural translation. Glosses follow the Leipzig Glossing Rules and a custom set of non-LGR abbreviations. Annotations are divided into "notes" and "gloss-notes," covering syntax, meaning, and cultural context.

## Gloss Design and Language Resource Standardization

Glossary abbreviations (LGR-compliant) and nonLGR abbreviations (Japanese-specific extensions) are maintained in JSON format. The gloss-linter tool assists with identifying undefined or ambiguous abbreviations. The gloss system is designed for modular reuse across multiple texts.

## PGM: Process Grammar Model

The Process Grammar Model conceptualizes speech generation along two axes: immediacy and adjustivity. It incorporates the Tasuki-gake Effect and context-based usage conditions. Formalizations are developed both descriptively and mathematically.

## Tool Development: gloss-linter, k2g, gloss-rewriter

A set of utility tools has been developed and maintained, including k2g (classical Japanese morphological parser), gloss-rewriter (abbreviation conversion), and gloss-linter (gloss consistency checker). Future plans include a GUI and integrated command-line interface.

## Outlook and Release Plans

- June 2025: Release of _Nihongo Notes Vol.1_ on Zenodo
- By end of 2025: Publication of PGM theoretical draft, AEAD reaching No.500, official release of gloss-linter, and completion of Ise and Tosa translations

The project will continue developing multi-layered approaches to descriptive grammar, with particular attention to the structure of meaning—including what remains unspoken.

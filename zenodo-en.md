## Overview

This entry presents a collection of permissibility rules for **Immediate Grammar (IG)**, a framework within the broader **Process Grammar Model (PGM)**. These rules clarify how expressions that are disallowed in traditional syntactic grammar may nevertheless be considered natural and valid in real-time speech and writing.

## Key Concept: Tasuki-gake Effect

**The Tasuki-gake Effect** describes a cross-contextual phenomenon that occurs when Immediate Grammar and Adjustment Grammar are used outside their typical contexts:

- When **Immediate Grammar** is used in structured or prepared media (novels, speeches), it adds vividness, speed, and naturalness to expression.
- When **Adjustment Grammar** is used in spontaneous, face-to-face contexts, it conveys politeness, formality, or ritual tone.

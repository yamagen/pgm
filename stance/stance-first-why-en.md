# Why We Must Begin with Stance

## 1. The Starting Point of Linguistic Research: Observable Sound and Script

Linguistic inquiry has historically begun with the observation of **spoken utterances produced by the human body and their written representations**. From ancient grammatical traditions—such as Panini's Sanskrit grammar or classical Greek grammars—to modern structural linguistics, language has been treated first and foremost as a formal, observable phenomenon.

Ferdinand de Saussure (1916) described language as a system of sound-signs, and Leonard Bloomfield (1933) defined language as the structure of human speech sounds. These perspectives frame language not as a repository of abstract meanings but as a sequence of perceivable events—**phonological strings that precede meaning reconstruction**.

Thus, linguistic description has long favored **the form of language as it is immediately perceived**, making phonetic and phonological units the primary analytical focus before semantic or conceptual content.

## 2. The Necessity of Stance in Immediate Grammar

### ▶ What is Immediate Grammar?

Immediate grammar refers to a framework that treats language as **an act of speaking that unfolds in real time**, without assuming the prior existence of fully-formed structure or meaning. It prioritizes the **temporal and interactional immediacy** of linguistic expression.

In such a framework, utterances always carry a **psychological attitude (stance)** at the moment of their production.

- For example, “Eh... well...” conveys hesitation (stance) before any propositional content is expressed.
- An isolated exclamation like “Yay!” instantly conveys joy without requiring syntactic structure.

In this way, **stance precedes meaning construction**, making it the core unit of immediate grammar. Hence:

> **Immediate grammar requires that we describe stance before structure.**

This is not a stylistic choice, but a structural necessity of how language operates in real time.

### ▶ Speech Always Embodies Stance

Speech is both form and attitude. Interjections, fillers, backchannels, and hesitation markers all demonstrate this:

- Utterances like “uh...”, “oh”, or “huh” express stance **before any semantic content emerges**.
- These cannot be adequately analyzed through lexical semantics alone—they must be accounted for through **stance-based description**.

## 3. Why Stance Comes First: Theoretical Justification

1. Language is first observed as sound and form; its **first perceptible quality is attitude**.
2. In immediate grammar, **stance appears before semantic or structural organization**.
3. Stance governs how words are used, what co-occurs, and which register or modality is selected.
4. Anchoring descriptions in stance enables consistent classification of polysemy and variation.
5. Stance reveals communicative effects that are invisible to meaning-label or embedding-only models.

## 4. Related Work: Theoretical Alignment with Stance Theory

Theoretical grounding for this stance-first approach can be found in the work of John W. Du Bois and Charles Goodwin.

Goodwin (2007), for example, studied a father helping his daughter with homework. Through physical alignment, gaze, and bodily stance, the two participants engaged in a struggle over how the shared task should be organized. Their **stances** were not conveyed solely through language, but through **interactive alignment, resistance, and affective response**—all temporally and socially embedded.

Your project’s triple+extension model—which seeks to classify expressions like “joy”, “hesitation”, or “anger”—shares its **core object of analysis** with Goodwin’s framework. Though their methodologies differ, both treat **stance as the central dynamic of language use**.

Du Bois (2007) adds further theoretical support by proposing the **Stance Triangle**, in which every linguistic act entails three interlinked activities:

- **Evaluation** of some content or proposition
- **Positioning** the speaker in relation to that content
- **Alignment** with the stance of others in the interaction

> The stance-centered structure of the triple+extension model is aligned with this framework and can be seen as an attempt to formalize Du Bois’s triangle in a descriptive grammar.

In summary, beginning with stance is not merely a matter of emphasis—it is a theoretical and empirical necessity grounded in the real-time, socially enacted nature of language. The triple+extension model, when centered on stance, provides a structurally stable and cognitively coherent foundation for describing the immediacy of human language.

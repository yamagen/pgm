# Stance First Theory: Immediate Language, Immediate Attitude

## 1. What is Stance First Theory?

**Stance First Theory** is a theoretical model that posits _stance_—the immediate psychological attitude or interpersonal orientation expressed through language—as the **primary organizing unit** of linguistic description. Rather than beginning with syntactic structure or propositional semantics, this theory asserts that linguistic meaning emerges from the **real-time positioning of speakers** as they interact with others and the world.

This theory was developed through the convergence of three ongoing projects:

- **Immediate Grammar**, which focuses on linguistic forms that arise spontaneously and cannot be delayed or revised
- **AEAD (An Expression A Day)**, a long-term documentation of naturally occurring Japanese expressions grounded in stance and context
- The formal modeling of **triple+extension structures**, which describe lexical items not only in terms of category and meaning, but in relation to stance

Together, these strands give rise to a model of language that is behaviorally grounded, structurally minimal, and interactionally rich.

## 2. Core Principles of Stance First Theory

### Principle 1: **Stance precedes structure**

In natural discourse, especially spoken language, people do not first construct syntactic forms and then add meaning. Instead, they begin with a stance—_a reaction, an intention, an evaluation_—which may or may not be followed by grammatical completion.

### Principle 2: **Stance is immediate and public**

Stance is not a latent mental state. It is manifest in sound, rhythm, timing, gesture, interjections, prosody, and even silence. It is what listeners first perceive and respond to.

### Principle 3: **Stance enables classification and meaning**

Words do not inherently “mean” joy or hesitation; they are used to _express_ these attitudes. The same lexical item may align with different stances in different contexts. Therefore, stance is the most stable axis for semantic classification.

### Principle 4: **Stance connects speaker, listener, and world**

Following Du Bois (2007), stance is not private or unidirectional. It is always constructed _in relation_—to others, to content, and to prior discourse.

## 3. Theoretical Lineage and Influence

- **Du Bois (2007)**: The _Stance Triangle_—evaluation, positioning, and alignment—as the minimal structure of interaction.
- **Goodwin (2007)**: Stance as a bodily, embodied, interactive alignment across participants and physical space.
- **Process Grammar Model**: The distinction between _immediate_ and _adjustive_ grammar provides the temporal and behavioral substrate in which stance operates.

## 4. Descriptive Infrastructure: Triple+Extension

Each linguistic unit (especially in AEAD) can be described using a minimal triplet:

```json
{
  "category": "emotive",
  "stance": "hesitation",
  "word": "えっと"
}
```

This can then be extended with:

- register, formality
- collocates and typical syntax
- example usage
- region, domain, source-type
- psychological effect (e.g., positive, ironic, distancing)

These elements enable both **symbolic description** and eventual projection into **semantic embedding** spaces.

## 5. Stance and Immediate Grammar

Immediate Grammar is the temporal grammar of **now**—not the abstract syntax of theoretical completeness. In this model, expressions such as:

- 「あー」
- 「だってさ」
- 「ほんとに？」

are not elliptical or fragmentary—they are **complete linguistic actions** whose primary meaning lies in their stance.

Stance First Theory thus provides the **semantic logic** of Immediate Grammar.

## 6. Future Directions

- Typology of stances across expressions (emotion, hesitation, agreement, irony, etc.)
- Integration with affective computing and real-time interaction systems
- Expansion of AEAD as a stance-labeled corpus
- Development of visualizations linking stance to co-occurrence, rhythm, and modality

## 7. Concluding Note

To describe language as it lives and breathes—_not after the fact, not in its ideal form, but in its first moment_—we must begin not with syntax, not even with meaning, but with **stance**.

This is the premise of Stance First Theory.

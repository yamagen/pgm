Immediate grammar is a grammar that corresponds to the situation where utterances are intuitively selected and promptly realized. Adjustive grammar is a grammar used for utterances with appropriate judgment and adjustment. We propose a process grammar model as a framework for describing language use with two extremes: one that must be spoken immediately and one that is spoken after careful consideration and adjustment. Immediate grammar is not just about speaking anything immediately; strict rules exist. Adjustive grammar is vital for choosing the right words and using the proper grammar. Still, depending on the degree of adjustment (or the degree of revision), there are several ways of expression and a state of over-adjustment. This model, which considers the time axis of expression, is not wholly different from all previous grammar studies, but a framework for further developing previous grammar studies.
